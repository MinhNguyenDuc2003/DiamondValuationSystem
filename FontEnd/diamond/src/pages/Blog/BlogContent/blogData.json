While some might prioritize more colorless diamonds, our reader knows their partner’s focus is on brilliance and size. By opting for a diamond with excellent cut grade, they ensure maximum light performance (i.e. a lot of fire and brilliance). Additionally, the VS1 clarity grade gives them minimal imperfections visible to the naked eye."

They know their partner isn’t too picky about color, so they have more options. Instead of focusing on things like how colorless the diamond is, they’re putting more importance on what their partner really cares about – how sparkly and big it is. This shows they understand what truly matters in selecting the perfect ring."
